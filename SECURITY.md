# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security vunerabilities will be 'fixed forward', i.e. the vunerability will be patched in a new release.
If you require a specific version to be patched, please get in touch by creating a [Creek-wide support discussion](https://github.com/orgs/creek-service/discussions/new?category=support)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please report it by either creating an 'bug' issue in the repo containing the issue, or create a [Creek-wide security discussion](https://github.com/orgs/creek-service/discussions/new?category=security) if the vulnerability affects multiple repositories.


## Timings

Creek is an open-source project maintained by volunteers. As such, we offer no hard and fast guarentees on response times. However, we aim to respond to all questions and issues within 7 days, and would obviously treat security issues with a higher priority.
